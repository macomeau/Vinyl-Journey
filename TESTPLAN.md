- Ensure the user interface is intuitive and responsive.
- Validate that all features work as intended.
- Identify and fix any bugs or issues.

## Scope

### In-Scope

- Functional Testing
- Integration Testing
- User Interface Testing

#### Future Testing
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing

### Out-of-Scope

- Load Testing
- Stress Testing

## Test Strategy

### Functional Testing

- [  ] Test importing album collections using valid and invalid Discogs user IDs and API tokens.
- [  ] Verify that albums display with correct details: artist, title, release year, cover image, and Discogs link.
- [  ] Test sorting functionality by artist, title, and release year in both ascending and descending order.
- [ x ] Ensure the random album feature displays a random album from the collection.

### Integration Testing

- [  ] Validate the integration with the Discogs API for data retrieval.
- [  ] Test database interactions with SQLite3 for storing and retrieving album data.

### User Interface Testing

- [  ] Check the responsiveness of the application on different devices and screen sizes.
- [  ] Verify that all UI elements are accessible and function correctly.

### Performance Testing

- [  ] Measure the application's response time for importing collections and displaying albums.
- [  ] Ensure the application performs well under normal usage conditions.

### Security Testing

- [  ] Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- [  ] Verify that user data is handled securely.

## Test Environment

- Node.js and Express.js server
- SQLite3 database
- Docker for containerization
- Supported browsers:
  - [ ] Chrome
  - [ ] Firefox
  - [ x ] Safari

## Test Schedule

- Week 1: Prepare test environment and write test cases.
- Week 2: Execute functional and integration tests.
- Week 3: Conduct UI, performance, and security tests.
- Week 4: Review test results and fix identified issues.

## Resources
